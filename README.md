[*SparkFun VR IMU Breakout - BNO086 (Qwiic)(SEN-22857)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22857)

An Arduino Library for the BNO08x IMU combination triple axis accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer packaged with an ARM Cortex M0+ running powerful algorithms.

The BNO08x IMU has a combination triple axis accelerometer/gyro/magnetometer packaged with an ARM&copy; Cortex&trade; M0+ running powerful algorithms. This enables the BNO08x Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to produce accurate rotation vector headings with an error of 2 degrees or less. It's what we've been waiting for: all the sensor data is combined into meaningful, accurate IMU information.

This IC was designed to be implemented in Android based cellular phones to handle all the computations necessary for virtual reality goggles using only your phone. The sensor is quite powerful but with power comes a complex interface. We've written an I<sup>2</sup>C based library that provides the rotation vector (the reading most folks want from an IMU) as well as raw acceleration, gyro, and magnetometer readings. The sensor is capable of communicating over SPI and UART as well!

In addition the BNO08x IMU provides a built-in step counter, tap detector, activity classifier (are you running, walking, or sitting still?), and a shake detector. We are duly impressed.

This Arduino Library was built off the [original library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library) written by Nathan Seidle ([SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com)).
